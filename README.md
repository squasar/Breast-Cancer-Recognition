# Breast-Cancer-Recognition

I used a part of my own algorithm with tensorflow in this project. I share only screenshots because the algorithm is mine and I can't let anyone knows even a part of it for now. 

It works on %96.6 accuracy in general (proved). For it is statistical meaningful result, I need to build a data center for developing this algorithm further.

You can examine the results and only some useless codes in screenshots.
